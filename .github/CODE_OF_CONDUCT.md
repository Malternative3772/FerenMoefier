<h2>Contribution Conduct</h2>

These are the contribution guidelines for Feren Moefier:

1. No NSFW content contributions - if you want an NSFW version of Feren Moefier, <b>go make one yourself.</b> The fork button's right up there.
2. No loli content contributions - the only exception to this rule is the stuff from Moebuntu (I'd just rather not risk it)
3. Don't be a douche in the issues or pull requests comments (I mean, you're probably risking breaching GitHub's own Terms of Service if you do that, even)
4. (for contributing any credits) Make sure you have the original source of the artwork for sure, and be sure to supply a link to the source (unless it's an anime frame in which case say what anime it's from, what season/movie and episode/movie it's from, and the anime's studio) as per the structure already set out in the current README.md (ultimately for consistency reasons).
5. (for reporting any issues) Make sure the issue you're having isn't just because of your distribution having been broken beforehand. Also please do attempt to get in contact with the author of the problematic resource (e.g.: Moebuntu for GTK problems).
6. Don't make contributions/issues for the heck of it
7. Don't break GitHub's ToS

Failure to comply may result in you being blocked from contributing to this repository.
